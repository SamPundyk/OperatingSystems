One function of an operating system is to provide the user with a graphical user interface (GUI). A GUI is basically a way for the user to interact with and issues commands to an operating system graphically, instead of purely text based or via a command line. With a GUI the operating system displays items visually on the screen in the form of objects such as tiles or icons, that the user can click on to interact with. For example the user clicks on an application icon to execute the start up of a program.
Memory management is another important function of an operating system. Your operating system controls what data is processed by what memory at different points in time. When a user issues a command to execute an application, the OS pulls data and instructions from long term storage on a hard disk. It moves it to RAM to be further processed, and more easily accessible by the processor. There can be various instructions of data for multiple applications, in memory at one time, and your operating system determines in what order this data is processed so that the system and all of its tasks run smoothly.
