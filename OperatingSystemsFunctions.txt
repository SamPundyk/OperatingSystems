One function of an operating system is to provide the user with a graphical user interface (GUI). A GUI is basically a way for the user to interact with and issues commands to an operating system graphically, instead of purely text based or via a command line. With a GUI the operating system displays items visually on the screen in the form of objects such as tiles or icons, that the user can click on to interact with. For example the user clicks on an application icon to execute the start up of a program.
